John Miller: Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining on short notice. The purpose of today’s meeting is to review the current status of the Alpha CRM modernization project and finalize the next sprint plan. We are currently two weeks away from the planned Phase 1 release, so we need to make sure all teams are aligned.

Sarah Khan: From the product side, the core requirements have been finalized. However, there are still a few pending approvals from the compliance department. I expect those approvals to come by February 10. Until then, we should avoid making major design changes.

Ravi Kumar: On the backend side, the authentication module is almost complete. We still need to integrate the new logging service. That task has been assigned to Ankit, and he has committed to finishing it by February 12. There is also a dependency on the DevOps team for setting up the staging database.

Emily Chen: The frontend team has completed about 70 percent of the UI redesign. The dashboard module is fully ready, but the reporting section is still in progress. I have assigned the reporting UI task to Michael with a target completion date of February 14. One concern is that the API responses are sometimes delayed, which is affecting our testing.

David Lopez: From a QA perspective, we have started preparing test cases. However, we cannot begin full regression testing until the staging environment is stable. I need confirmation from DevOps on when that environment will be ready. Ideally, we should start testing by February 15 to stay on schedule.

Priya Nair: I want to highlight a few business-side risks. The sales team has requested two additional features related to customer analytics. These were not part of the original scope. If we decide to include them, the timeline might slip by at least one week. We need a clear decision from management on this by the end of this week.

John Miller: That’s a good point, Priya. I will schedule a separate meeting with the stakeholders tomorrow to finalize the scope. For now, let’s continue with the originally agreed features.

Sarah Khan: Another open issue is user training. The operations team needs updated documentation before the release. We should assign someone to start working on training materials.

John Miller: Agreed. Emily, can someone from your team take ownership of the user manual?

Emily Chen: Yes, I will assign that task to Rachel. She can prepare the first draft by February 18.

Ravi Kumar: One more technical risk I want to mention is related to data migration. The legacy CRM data is not fully clean, and we may face issues while importing it into the new system. We might need additional scripts to handle edge cases.

John Miller: Thanks for raising that. Ravi, please prepare a small risk assessment document on data migration and share it with the team by February 11.

David Lopez: Also, we need clarity on performance benchmarks. Without defined metrics, it will be hard for QA to sign off on the release.

Sarah Khan: I can provide the expected performance criteria. I will share that document with David by February 9.

John Miller: Excellent. Let’s summarize the key action items:

Ankit to complete logging service integration by February 12.

DevOps to confirm staging environment readiness date.

Michael to finish reporting UI by February 14.

Rachel to prepare user manual draft by February 18.

Ravi to share data migration risk document by February 11.

Sarah to provide performance benchmark document by February 9.

Are there any other concerns?

Priya Nair: Just one more. We still haven’t finalized the customer feedback collection process after release. That needs to be defined.

John Miller: Good catch. Let’s discuss that in next week’s planning meeting.

If there are no further points, we will conclude here. Thanks everyone for the updates. Let’s stay focused and meet the deadlines.

Meeting Adjourned.
